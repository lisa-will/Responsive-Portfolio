					<p>
					I am a 28 year old mother of one, beach loving baby. I fancy myself as an artist, writer, and clean water activist. I hope one day to help push the envelope towards renewable energy sources and ensure clean water for future generations through web development.<br><br>
					Sound a little crazy? Here's some food for <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-web-developer-save-a-country" target="_blank">thought.</a>
					<br><br>
					Speaking of food, I make a mean coconut curry! Some other fun facts about me are: I love languages, but am a master of none.
					I collect labbits, because they come in mystery boxes. I am one of those people who loves to put Sriracha or Tabasco sauce on just about every meal, and I may be known to carry a small travel size bottle with me just in case.  
					<br>
					I have lived on a hand-full of islands in the US including Manhattan, another is technically considered a peninsula, so don't let the name fool you. I have never been to California, but I have traveled to Poland, France, and London.
					<br><br>
					Can you guess the other islands? Here's a Hint: All are located on the East Coast of two polar opposite states.
